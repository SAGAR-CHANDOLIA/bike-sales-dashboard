# Bike Sales Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Excel dashboard built from a bike sales dataset to uncover key insights about customer purchase behavior. The dataset includes over 1000 records and has been cleaned and transformed to support analysis.

## Objectives
- Understand purchase patterns by gender, age group, and commute distance
- Enable data-driven decision-making with dynamic filters (slicers)
- Visualize growth opportunities across customer demographics
